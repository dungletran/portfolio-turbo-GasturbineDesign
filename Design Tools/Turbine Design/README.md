This file is going to explain how to run the aero-thermodynamics calculation for the turbine.

1. There are three files needed for this calculation. 'efficiencyiteration.m','designturbine.m' and 'turbine data.xlsx'. 

2. The 'efficiencyiteration.m' file is the code to run to generate the efficiency iterated data. The 'designturbine.m' is a function used to calculate all the turbine stages parameters, including the thermodynamics properties and geometry information. The 'turbine data.xlsx' is the data file recorded from the matlab code.
