1. The excel file 'cal' is used for the compressor stage design 
2. The excel file 'Cal_losses' is used for calculating the losses and efficiency (both polytropic and isentropic) of the compressor. It also calculates the blade parameters for the blade meanline. These can be accessed in the 'Comp_combine' sheet. 
3. The excel file 'Cal_tip' is used for calculating the blade parameters at the tip. These can be accessed in the 'Comp_combine' sheet. 
4. The excel file 'Cal_hub' is used for calculating the blade parameters at the hub. These can be accessed in the 'Comp_combine' sheet. 
5. The excel file 'Cax_comp' is used for calculating the stagger angle of the compressor blades and the chord axial length of the blades. 
6. The matlab file 'code_compressor_blade' is used to build the compressor blades. The input for the matlab file is the chord length and lift coefficient.The matlab code contatins furthur instructions.
